#descrption:Forest fire detection is a critical process used to identify and respond to wildfires in their early stages. Timely detection helps minimize damage to ecosystems, wildlife, and human life. Traditional methods include watchtowers and patrolling, but they often lack accuracy and speed. Modern systems utilize technologies like satellite imagery, drones, and sensor networks. AI and machine learning algorithms analyze environmental data to detect fire-prone conditions. Temperature, humidity, smoke, and flame sensors are commonly deployed in vulnerable areas. Real-time alerts enable faster response by emergency services. Remote sensing allows for wide-area coverage with minimal human involvement. Integration with GPS and IoT enhances tracking and communication. Effective forest fire detection can significantly reduce the impact of wildfires globally.
